        Well hello! I am Bezawit which you already know if you make it this far
        ðŸ˜Œ. So to say a little about my professional journey, I joined campus at
        2019 and later majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering. so here
        is how i shifted to Computer Programming. it was time to choose stream
        and I made some research by asking seniors what's the latest Job market
        about and they told me programming is a huge deal, and its fun to learn
        because its actually the thing we will be doing when we graduate. I was
        so passionate about giing it a try but now I am into it, I am doing it
        not trying. Iam part of the developer teams at Bazra Motors. But during
        campus internship I have worked as an intern for just 3 months at Kifiya
        Financial Technology PLC and it was so good. I improved my coding,
        presentation, communicating my works and the work environment including
        being professional and helped me decide my career path.
